# The prebuilt Java object YetToYes2.jar is included.
# Building it from source would require the Android build-tools and API.

# Several minified Javascript objects are included.
# Upstream did this intentionally.
# There is several minifiers, like YUI, Uglify.JS, and others.
# Each of them employs their own algorithms to makes the source smaller.
# Upstream included the minified versions provided by the developers.
# This way they are more sure to have well-tested and reliable minified objects.
